#### Development will be slowed down as I am working on other projects but when I have the chance to, I will check on the pull requests and issues once I can.

## Desciption

This basic music player is built using Python and primarily relies on the integration of Tkinter and Pygame. The application combines the user-friendly interface provided by Tkinter with the powerful audio playback capabilities of Pygame. With this music player, users can easily navigate through their music collection, select songs, and enjoy a seamless listening experience. Tkinter enables the creation of a visually appealing and intuitive interface, while Pygame handles the playback of audio files, ensuring high-quality sound output. Together, these technologies come together to offer a simple yet effective music player for Python enthusiasts like me.
